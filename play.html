            <h3>_Same as Act I(Drawing-room in Lord Windermere’shouse.) </h3>
            <p>LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Lying on sofa_.]  How can I tell him?  I can’t tell
                him.  It would kill me.  I wonder what happened after I escaped from that
                horrible room.  Perhaps she told them the true reason of her being there,
                and the real meaning of that—fatal fan of mine.  Oh, if he knows—how can
                I look him in the face again?  He would never forgive me.  [_Touches
                bell_.]  How securely one thinks one lives—out of reach of temptation,
                sin, folly.  And then suddenly—Oh!  Life is terrible.  It rules us, we do
                not rule it.
                
                
                [_Enter_ PARKER.]
                
                PARKER.  Mrs. Erlynne.
                
                [_Enter_ MRS. ERLYNNE.]
                
                                                                          [_Exit_ PARKER.]
                
                MRS. ERLYNNE.  How do you do, Lady Windermere?  [_To_ LORD WINDERMERE.]
                How do you do?  Do you know, Lady Windermere, I am so sorry about your
                fan.  I can’t imagine how I made such a silly mistake.  Most stupid of
                me.  And as I was driving in your direction, I thought I would take the
                opportunity of returning your property in person with many apologies for
                my carelessness, and of bidding you good-bye.
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  Good-bye?  [_Moves towards sofa with_ MRS. ERLYNNE _and
                sits down beside her_.]  Are you going away, then, Mrs. Erlynne?
                
                MRS. ERLYNNE.  Yes; I am going to live abroad again.  The English climate
                doesn’t suit me.  My—heart is affected here, and that I don’t like.  I
                prefer living in the south.  London is too full of fogs and—and serious
                people, Lord Windermere.  Whether the fogs produce the serious people or
                whether the serious people produce the fogs, I don’t know, but the whole
                thing rather gets on my nerves, and so I’m leaving this afternoon by the
                Club Train.
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  This afternoon?  But I wanted so much to come and see
                you.
                
                MRS. ERLYNNE.  How kind of you!  But I am afraid I have to go.
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  Shall I never see you again, Mrs. Erlynne?
                
                MRS. ERLYNNE.  I am afraid not.  Our lives lie too far apart.  But there
                is a little thing I would like you to do for me.  I want a photograph of
                you, Lady Windermere—would you give me one?  You don’t know how gratified
                I should be.
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  Oh, with pleasure.  There is one on that table.  I’ll
                show it to you. [_Goes across to the table_.]
                
                LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Coming up to_ MRS. ERLYNNE _and speaking in a low
                voice_.]  It is monstrous your intruding yourself here after your conduct
                last night.
                
                MRS. ERLYNNE.  [_With an amused smile_.]  My dear Windermere, manners
                before morals!
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Returning_.]  I’m afraid it is very flattering—I am
                not so pretty as that.  [_Showing photograph_.]
                
                MRS. ERLYNNE.  You are much prettier.  But haven’t you got one of
                yourself with your little boy?
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  I have.  Would you prefer one of those?
                
                MRS. ERLYNNE.  Yes.
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  I’ll go and get it for you, if you’ll excuse me for a
                moment.  I have one upstairs.
                
                MRS. ERLYNNE.  So sorry, Lady Windermere, to give you so much trouble.
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Moves to door R._]  No trouble at all, Mrs. Erlynne.
                
                MRS. ERLYNNE.  Thanks so much.
                
                [_Exit_ LADY WINDERMERE _R._]  You seem rather out of temper this
                morning, Windermere.  Why should you be?  Margaret and I get on
                charmingly together.
                
                LORD WINDERMERE.  I can’t bear to see you with her.  Besides, you have
                not told me the truth, Mrs. Erlynne.
                
                MRS. ERLYNNE.  I have not told _her_ the truth, you mean.
                
                LORD WINDERMERE.  [_Standing C._]  I sometimes wish you had.  I should
                have been spared then the misery, the anxiety, the annoyance of the last
                six months.  But rather than my wife should know—that the mother whom she
                was taught to consider as dead, the mother whom she has mourned as dead,
                is living—a divorced woman, going about under an assumed name, a bad
                woman preying upon life, as I know you now to be—rather than that, I was
                ready to supply you with money to pay bill after bill, extravagance after
                extravagance, to risk what occurred yesterday, the first quarrel I have
                ever had with my wife.  You don’t understand what that means to me.  How
                could you?  But I tell you that the only bitter words that ever came from
                those sweet lips of hers were on your account, and I hate to see you next
                her.  You sully the innocence that is in her. [_Moves L.C._]  And then I
                used to think that with all your faults you were frank and honest.  You
                are not.
                
                MRS. ERLYNNE.  Why do you say that?
                
                LORD WINDERMERE.  You made me get you an invitation to my wife’s ball.
                
                MRS. ERLYNNE.  For my daughter’s ball—yes.
                
                LORD WINDERMERE.  You came, and within an hour of your leaving the house
                you are found in a man’s rooms—you are disgraced before every one.
                [_Goes up stage C._]
                
                MRS. ERLYNNE.  Yes.
                
                
                LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Frightened_.]  Has Mrs. Erlynne—?
                
                LORD AUGUSTUS.  [_Advancing towards her with a low bow_.]  Yes, Lady
                Windermere—  Mrs. Erlynne has done me the honour of accepting my hand.
                
                LORD WINDERMERE.  Well, you are certainly marrying a very clever woman!
                LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Taking her husband’s hand_.]  Ah, you’re marrying a
                very good woman!
