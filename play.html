            <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LADY WINDERMERE.</H5> <p class="stage_directions"> [_Lying on sofa_.]</p>  <p class="speech">How can I tell him?  I can’t tell
                him.  It would kill me.  I wonder what happened after I escaped from that
                horrible room.  Perhaps she told them the true reason of her being there,
                and the real meaning of that—fatal fan of mine.  Oh, if he knows—how can
                I look him in the face again?  He would never forgive me.</p>  <p class="stage_directions">[_Touches
                bell_.]</p> <p class="speech">How securely one thinks one lives—out of reach of temptation,
                sin, folly.  And then suddenly—Oh!  Life is terrible.  It rules us, we do
                not rule it.</p>
                
                
                <P class="stage_directions">[_Enter_ PARKER.]</P>

                <H5 class="name  MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE</H5>. <p class="speech">How do you do, Lady Windermere?</p>  <p class="stage_directions">[_To_ LORD WINDERMERE.]</p>
                <p class="speech">How do you do?  Do you know, Lady Windermere, I am so sorry about your
                fan.  I can’t imagine how I made such a silly mistake.  Most stupid of
                me.  And as I was driving in your direction, I thought I would take the
                opportunity of returning your property in person with many apologies for
                my carelessness, and of bidding you good-bye.</p>
                
                <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE.">LADY WINDERMRE</H5>  <p class="speech">Good-bye?</p>  <p class="stage_directions">[_Moves towards sofa with_ MRS. ERLYNNE _and
                sits down beside her_.]</p>  <p class="speech">Are you going away, then, Mrs. Erlynne?</p>
                
                <H5 class="name  MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</H5>  <p class="speech">Yes; I am going to live abroad again.  The English climate
                doesn’t suit me.  My—heart is affected here, and that I don’t like.  I
                prefer living in the south.  London is too full of fogs and—and serious
                people, Lord Windermere.  Whether the fogs produce the serious people or
                whether the serious people produce the fogs, I don’t know, but the whole
                thing rather gets on my nerves, and so I’m leaving this afternoon by the
                Club Train.</p>
                
                <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LADY WINDERMERE.</H5>  <p class="speech">This afternoon?  But I wanted so much to come and see
                you.</p>
                
                <H5 class="name  MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</H5>  <p class="speech">How kind of you!  But I am afraid I have to go.</p>
                
                <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LADY WINDERMERE.</H5>  <p class="speech">Shall I never see you again, Mrs. Erlynne?</p>
                
                <H5 class="name  MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</H5>  <p class="speech">I am afraid not.  Our lives lie too far apart.  But there
                is a little thing I would like you to do for me.  I want a photograph of
                you, Lady Windermere—would you give me one?  You don’t know how gratified
                I should be.</p>
                
                <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LADY WINDERMERE.</H5>  <p class="speech">Oh, with pleasure.  There is one on that table.  I’ll
                show it to you.</p> <p class="stage_directions">[_Goes across to the table_.]</p>
                
                <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LORD WINDERMERE.</H5>  <p class="stage_directions">[_Coming up to_ MRS. ERLYNNE _and speaking in a low
                voice_.]</p>  <p class="speech">It is monstrous your intruding yourself here after your conduct
                last night.</p>
                
                <H5 class="name  MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</H5>  <p class="stage_directions">[_With an amused smile_.]</p>  <p class="speech">My dear Windermere, manners
                before morals!''</p>
                
                <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LADY WINDERMERE.</H5>  <p class="stage_directions">[_Returning_.]</p>  <p class="speech">I’m afraid it is very flattering—I am
                not so pretty as that.</p> <p class="stage_directions">[_Showing photograph_.]</p>
                
        
                <H5 class="name  MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</H5>  <p class="speech">You are much prettier.  But haven’t you got one of
                yourself with your little boy?</p>
                
                <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LADY WINDERMERE.</H5>  <p class="speech">I have.  Would you prefer one of those?</p>
                
                <H5 class="name  MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</H5>  <p class="speech">Yes.</p>
                
                <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LADY WINDERMERE.</H5> <p class="speech">I’ll go and get it for you, if you’ll excuse me for a
                moment.  I have one upstairs.</p>
                
                <H5 class="name  MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</H5>  <p class="speech">So sorry, Lady Windermere, to give you so much trouble.</p>
                
                <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LADY WINDERMERE.</H5>  <p class="stage_directions">[_Moves to door R._]</p>  <p class="speech">No trouble at all, Mrs. Erlynne.</p>
                
                <H5 class="name  MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</H5>  <p class="speech">Thanks so much.</p>
                
                <p>[_Exit_ LADY WINDERMERE _R._]  You seem rather out of temper this
                morning, Windermere.  Why should you be?  Margaret and I get on
                charmingly together.</p>
                
                <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LORD WINDERMERE.</H5>  <p class="speech">I can’t bear to see you with her.  Besides, you have
                not told me the truth, Mrs. Erlynne.</p>
                
                <H5 class="name  MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</H5>  <p class="speech">I have not told _her_ the truth, you mean.</p>
                
                <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LORD WINDERMERE.</H5>  <p class="stage directions">[_Standing C._]</p>  <p class="speech">I sometimes wish you had.  I should
                have been spared then the misery, the anxiety, the annoyance of the last
                six months.  But rather than my wife should know—that the mother whom she
                was taught to consider as dead, the mother whom she has mourned as dead,
                is living—a divorced woman, going about under an assumed name, a bad
                woman preying upon life, as I know you now to be—rather than that, I was
                ready to supply you with money to pay bill after bill, extravagance after
                extravagance, to risk what occurred yesterday, the first quarrel I have
                ever had with my wife.  You don’t understand what that means to me.  How
                could you?  But I tell you that the only bitter words that ever came from
                those sweet lips of hers were on your account, and I hate to see you next
                her.  You sully the innocence that is in her. [_Moves L.C._]  And then I
                used to think that with all your faults you were frank and honest.  You
                are not.</p>
                
                <H5 class="name  MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</H5>  <p class="speech">Why do you say that?</p>
                
                <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LORD WINDERMERE.</H5>  <p class="speech">You made me get you an invitation to my wife’s ball.</p>
                
                <H5 class="name  MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</H5>  <p class="speech">For my daughter’s ball—yes.</p>
                
                <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LORD WINDERMERE.</H5>  <p class="speech">You came, and within an hour of your leaving the house
                you are found in a man’s rooms—you are disgraced before every one.</p>
                <p class="stage_directions">[_Goes up stage C._]</p>
                
                <H5 class="name  MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</H5>  <p class="speech">Yes.</p>
                
                
                <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LADY WINDERMERE.</H5>  <p class="stage_directions">[_Frightened_.]</p>  <p class="speech">Has Mrs. Erlynne—?</p>
                
                <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LORD WINDERMERE.</H5>  <p class="speech">Well, you are certainly marrying a very clever woman!</p>
                <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LADY WINDERMERE.</H5>  <p class="stage_directions">[_Taking her husband’s hand_.]</p>  <p class="speech">Ah, you’re marrying a
