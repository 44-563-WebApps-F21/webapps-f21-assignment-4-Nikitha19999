            <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LADY WINDERMERE.</H5> <p class="stage_directions"> [_Lying on sofa_.]</p>  <p class="speech">How can I tell him?  I can’t tell
                him.  It would kill me.  I wonder what happened after I escaped from that
                horrible room.  Perhaps she told them the true reason of her being there,
                and the real meaning of that—fatal fan of mine.  Oh, if he knows—how can
                I look him in the face again?  He would never forgive me.</p>  <p class="stage_directions">[_Touches
                bell_.]</p> <p class="speech">How securely one thinks one lives—out of reach of temptation,
                sin, folly.  And then suddenly—Oh!  Life is terrible.  It rules us, we do
                not rule it.</p>

                <p class="speech">How do you do?  Do you know, Lady Windermere, I am so sorry about your
                fan.  I can’t imagine how I made such a silly mistake.  Most stupid of
                me.  And as I was driving in your direction, I thought I would take the
                opportunity of returning your property in person with many apologies for
                my carelessness, and of bidding you good-bye.</p>
                <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LADY WINDERMERE.</H5>  <p class="speech">This afternoon?  But I wanted so much to come and see
                    you.</p>
                    
                    <H5 class="name  MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</H5>  <p class="speech">How kind of you!  But I am afraid I have to go.</p>
                    
                    <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LADY WINDERMERE.</H5>  <p class="speech">Shall I never see you again, Mrs. Erlynne?</p>
                    
                    <H5 class="name  MRS. ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</H5>  <p class="speech">I am afraid not.  Our lives lie too far apart.  But there
                    is a little thing I would like you to do for me.  I want a photograph of
                    you, Lady Windermere—would you give me one?  You don’t know how gratified
                    I should be.</p>
                    
                    <H5 class="name LADY WINDERMERE." >LADY WINDERMERE.</H5>  <p class="speech">Oh, with pleasure.  There is one on that table.  I’ll
                    show it to you.</p> <p class="stage_directions">[_Goes across to the table_.]</p>
